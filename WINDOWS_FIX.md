# 🪟 Windows Fix Applied!

## ✅ What Was Fixed:
- Removed hardcoded Replit Chromium path
- Now uses Playwright's default browser (works on Windows!)

## 📥 **You Need to Re-Download:**

Since you already downloaded the old version, you need the updated files:

### **Option 1: Re-Download Everything (Easiest)**
1. In Replit: Click **3-dot menu (⋮)** → **Download as ZIP**
2. Extract to a NEW folder
3. Delete your old folder
4. Run the installer in the new folder

### **Option 2: Just Update app/config.py (Quick)**
1. In Replit, open: `product-research-tool-starter/app/config.py`
2. Find line 4-7 (the CHROMIUM_BIN section)
3. Replace it with:
```python
# Browser configuration
# Use Playwright's default Chromium (works on Windows, Mac, Linux)
# Set CHROMIUM_BIN env variable to override if needed
CHROMIUM_BIN = os.getenv("CHROMIUM_BIN", None)  # None = use Playwright default
```
4. Save and download just this file
5. Replace it in your local folder

## 🚀 After Fixing:

Run the scraper again:
```
python distributed_scraper.py
```

**It will now use the Chromium you installed with Playwright!** ✅

- ✅ Workers processing keywords
- ✅ Ads being saved
- ❌ NO "executable doesn't exist" error

The scraper will work perfectly on Windows now! 🎉
